# Cavag

The documentation is available at [bobdadada.github.io/cavag](https://bobdadada.github.io/cavag).

> This packages mainly used to
>
> 1. solve Gaussian optical transmission model
> 2. solve the Fabry-Perot cavity
> 3. solve the Fiber Fabry-Perot Cavity
>

**cavag** consists of the following modules:

- <font color="limegreen">fiber</font>
- <font color="limegreen">fpcavity</font>
- <font color="limegreen">gaussbeam</font>
- <font color="limegreen">mirror</font>
- <font color="limegreen">misc</font>
- <font color="limegreen">utils</font>

Each modules define lots of useful classes and functions about Fiber, Fabry-Perot Cavity, Gaussian Beam and Mirror. Through the combined use of various modules, one can solve specific problems about cavity quantum mechanics. Each module is easy to simplify and expand.
