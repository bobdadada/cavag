# Cavag

The documentation is available at [bobdadada.github.io/cavag](https://bobdadada.github.io/cavag).

> This packages mainly used to
>
> 1. solve Gaussian optical transmission model
> 2. solve the Fabry-Perot cavity
> 3. solve the Fiber Fabry-Perot Cavity

**cavag** consists of the following modules:

- <span style="color:limegreen;">fiber</span>
- <span style="color:limegreen;">fpcavity</span>
- <span style="color:limegreen;">hgbeam</span>
- <span style="color:limegreen;">mirror</span>
- <span style="color:limegreen;">misc</span>
- <span style="color:limegreen;">extension</span>

Each modules define lots of useful classes and functions about Fiber, Fabry-Perot Cavity, Gaussian Beam and Mirror. Through the combined use of various modules, one can solve specific problems about cavity quantum mechanics. Each module is easy to simplify and expand.
