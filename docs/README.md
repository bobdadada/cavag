**cavag** consists of the following modules:

- <font color="limegreen">entities</font>

  - <font color="limegreen">fiber</font>

  - <font color="limegreen">fpcavity</font>

  - <font color="limegreen">gaussbeam</font>

  - <font color="limegreen">mirror</font>

- <font color="limegreen">utils</font>

Each modules define lots of useful classes and functions about Fiber, Fabry-Perot Cavity, Gaussian Beam and Mirror. Through the combined use of various modules, one can solve specific problems about cavity quantum mechanics. Each module is easy to simplify and expand.
