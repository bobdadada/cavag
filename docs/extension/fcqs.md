## Physical Background

In addition to loss, we also need to consider the coupling efficiency between the various components, including:

the power coupling efficiency $\epsilon$ between the fiber and cavity modes can be approximated simply by the overlap integral of the fiber and cavity mode intensity distributions, neglecting phase mismatch,
$$
\eta_{mode}=\frac{4}{\left(\frac{\omega_f}{\omega_m}+\frac{\omega_m}{\omega_f}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\pi n_f \omega_f \omega_m}{\lambda\cdot \text{ROC}}\right)^2}
$$
where $n_f$ is the refractive index of the fiber and $\text{ROC}$ the $\text{ROC}$ of the mirror
